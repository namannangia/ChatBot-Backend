Have you ever heard of ServiceNow? ServiceNow has many aspects and forms. Today we're going to concentrate on incident management form of ServiceNow, also known as ServiceDesk, also known as a help desk ticketing system. Many companies are using ServiceNow as their ticketing system and for those reasons we're going to learn about it just in case you need to get a job that requires ServiceNow knowledge. So here's ServiceNow. By looking at it you wouldn't be able to tell that this is ServiceNow. Why? Because I've modified it and customized it, the front end of it, to my liking. Now this is very similar to other companies that what they're doing too. They would pay ServiceNow to provide them with ServiceDesk slash help desk system that they can modify to their own liking and they can change the look, the things, the logos and everything else. Today's video I'm going to concentrate on ServiceDesk part of it where we deal with incidents. ServiceNow has lots of different products and it's pretty cool in many ways but my channel is mostly about help desk and tech support and for those reasons we're going to talk about that. I will teach you how to create tickets, how to assign tickets to yourself, how to see other open tickets, how to see if anybody else is working on those tickets, all those things that you would need to get you started as somebody who can claim on their resume that they are familiar with ServiceNow when it comes to ServiceDesk part of it. So it entirely depends on how it's set up and how it's designed to look for you and for the users. It's very important because users may not even see this part of it at all whenever they submit tickets. To them they're going to probably just see a web page where they just type in basic information and through that web page they will submit a ticket that comes through us. Now if I was a user and I submitted a ticket I would see that ticket under self-service option which is the very first thing that we are looking at here. So if I click on self-service and this menu expands and then I click on incidents these are the tickets these are the issues that I as a user have submitted. This is not the place where you would work ServiceDesk slash help desk. This is not for you this is for the users. So anything under option of self-service that means it's personally for the users or if you submitted your own ticket this is where we would be at. Now if you're working help desk this is not where you're going to be spending time because you're going to be working on other people's tickets on users tickets. Now you may get a menu that looks like this. So this is kind of what they've did recently I think they've changed the look of it and again you can customize this many ways but if you're not seeing your tab your column tabs on the option select all and the way I like it is actually to pin all the menus because for some reason I like it where I can see the menus. Now I know you see a lot over here and the reason you see a lot over here is because I'm logged in as full administrator designer developer of this system of this ticketing system. When you work as help desk when you get hired to work as help desk you will see mostly this here and what we're looking for is the tab that's called incident and here it is I have it starred. So once you log in this is pretty much what you would see just these here and then you would see the self-service menu as well on top but when you start working for some company they will be showing you this part of it and you will not see anything that's underneath here just these parts here which are important and relevant to you directly. So now that we get that out of the way what do we have under the incident option we have create new meaning to create a new ticket then we got tickets assigned to you which is it says assigned to me so if I click on this I can see all the tickets that are assigned to me and then we've got open these are all open tickets so I clicked on open these are all open tickets and assigned to other people in your group. So this is what you would see all tickets that are open and still not completed they're still open and not completed right and you can see who they're assigned to if you look on the right hand side it says assigned to so this column will show you who is working on these tickets already but if you click on open unassigned these are all tickets that nobody is working on nobody has touched but they are part of your group they are part of your group so even if you're just doing tech support like on site somewhere for a location you would see this type of menu not just help desk so this would be specific to your group only now the other menus we have are resolved these are all tickets that have been resolved and then we've got all which is pretty much all the tickets that we've seen for your group and this and that so it'll be limited to your group everything else we don't have to necessarily worry about there is a way to also look at the statistics for your entire group the graphs and everything like that but that's not something you need to worry about when it comes to learning how to use this help desk all right so let's start from the top we're going to click create new so we can create a ticket we're going to talk about it we're going to create it so why would you want to learn about this because as help desk you get a phone call or somebody contacts you in some way you have to fill out a ticket and usually help desk involves you answering the phone right and here it is here is the ticket number that it's automatically created and then we've got a caller and then we've got asterisks right by it right what does that mean the red asterisk means that this is a required field you have to fill this out otherwise it will not let you go further notice these other menus don't have that asterisk and that's fine because it may help us actually fill this out easier but the ones that are required they will also be listed there and some companies will require all of these now this is a system that I've created designed myself I don't know if I mentioned that already so there are some things in there that are not completely there but everything that you need to know everything is here so you don't have to worry about any of that stuff and we're going to pretend like we got a caller in and luckily we got a lot of callers in the system so I'm just going to we can do a search here you can type in somebody's name now this is very case sensitive my company has been using service now for many years now and it's very case sensitive I've noticed where you have to sometimes type in last name first comma and then their full first name but let's just do a search here we're going to pick a random person we're going to see if we can find them in the system let's pick Carla Humble here I'm not going to select here here but I'm going to pretend that Carla called in so let's see if it's a little bit better than in my company Carla Humble okay this is great it's actually better set up than the company I work for and it actually finds them usually you have to be very case sensitive sometimes it doesn't work properly luckily we can find Carla Humble right there let's see if we type in Humble if she will come up okay so it's not finding her now let's do a search it luckily it pulled her up right now so that's great it's actually better design than the version that we are using for my company all right so we're going to select Carla Humble you know make sure you find the user's name inside of the system and if you click on icon that's next to the search button you can see show related incidents to her okay and then we got a category here which is inquiry help let's just say she's calling in to get help with something we can leave it at that we can specify software hardware network or database issues but let's start from the first one which is inquiry help we got a subcategory and then we can pick something that they might be calling about again your company may have more menus chances I will have different and more menus as well for categories for subcategories everything else may be different but the base of it and what you're looking at is going to be the same okay so you don't have to worry about that if you got more options even better so let's pretend it's email issue that she is calling about and we've got type of service we're not going to talk about that it's just not necessary to talk about the service part and service offering you don't have to worry about that for now this is something your employer will tell you what to put in there we do have a lot of options if we go to service and we can pick all of these type of different things whatever it is whatever the issue is but if it's like for example it service or some kind of retail server it gets very complex and for those reasons you're going to have to ask your employer what do I need to put in for this they need to train you for this part of it so we're going to skip that for now because I don't want to confuse you with that and this is directly related to that service offering so don't worry about that however what's actually important is and this is how it is set up in my company and that is configuration item here now in my company it's set up that I can pull up computer name so I can pull up configure configuration item computer name or let's say it's a monitor this and that but that would be simply pulled up by typing computer's workstation name or host name or computer name however you want to call it so let's just call it computer computer name and it should come up you can also ask the user and what it is but a lot of times if this system is set up properly for example for Carla Humble here if I just simply click inside of this configuration item it should come up as an option for you to select that we know whatever her workstation name is that is registered to her that you know as long as everything is done as long as everything is designed properly this should be functioning perfectly so let's just see what we have when we click the search icon here look up by using a list and you know there are a lot of stuff in here and you can see some of these products are here's for example macbook pro 17 inch apple computer and it's assigned to genie dalen so this is something that's assigned to her and for those reasons if you know Janie or for example Isaac here or Kyle log in or call in I should say you can select this thing this computer that's assigned to them as a configuration item let me see if there's anything generic here in my company we have a generic workstation as well let me see if anything comes up we'll definitely pick something yeah I didn't think it would have let me see if for example if software here it is software see this is one problem with this system which I don't like software installer software so how do you pick something let's see outlook that would make sense there it is outlook so that's perfect that makes actually more sense I got distracted by the hardware part of it anyways so we've got email they are calling about email issue and then we select an outlook so whatever is that they're talking about then you can fill this out sorry about that anyways we can type in what the issue is we can say user called in about outlook emails not working okay and then we can provide description for example user tried to tried to let's say user stated that she is no longer receiving new emails inside the inbox folder whatever is that the issue is you need to fill this out and this is you doing it on behalf of the user and then if we look below here these are all knowledge articles if you will and a lot of times they are based off previous issues that happen here it is for example deleted email recovery and these are all related articles that you can kind of look at to see if you can help the user for example let's say they're calling about create an email signature you can click on this and see what the resolution is for that for that issue that happened and then the before we go further we got a channel here and we can specify on what it is how did they reach you and you can say they reached me by chat email or phone in this case we were talking to the user and then state we can say new which is fine and this is you know low impact you just kind of use your own judgment and whatever the company trains you to do but in my case this is a low impact for now unless Carla Humble is a CEO or a director or senior manager then in this case you want to change the urgency to like high or medium let's do medium because you know why not and then we can change the priority as well to something else now assignment group we can assign it to other groups in this case we can assign it to help desk so we're going to assign it to help desk okay and then once we're done with this we can assign it to help desk and once we're done with this we can click submit you can also resolve issues if the issue has been resolved right away you can certainly do that however you will have to provide resolution information now if we are just sending this ticket to help desk right we oh that's all we do and we're not able to help them then we're going to click submit and that ticket is going to go over there which which is what we're going to do in the end however if you've resolved the issue you can go ahead and submit the ticket which is right here to the right however you have to fill out the resolution information which is here otherwise it will not let you close it and we will actually do that once we submit the ticket and I'll show you how to do that so for now we're just going to click submit we're going to click submit and then we're going to look for this here and you can also search for tickets when you create them or for example somebody calls you and they say hey my ticket hasn't been resolved and the first question it should be is what is the ticket number so they provide you the ticket number now if there are thousands of tickets in the system for a large company you're going to want that ticket number so that way you can search for it and then see what the issue is to give it the status I apologize this is you know taking a bit to actually submit it's usually not like this but all right there it goes now here is our ticket that came up right away on up top so if we select open we can see our ticket on top right here user called in about our ticket and we can verify that that did that that indeed is our ticket here is a paste action of it let's do a search and here it is and it was automatically assigned to Fred Ludy so Fred Ludy works over there at help desk and now he's working on it you can also search for a ticket up here if you do a search for this it will also come up and here it is so you got a couple of ways of searching for tickets it results in the same way except when you go through here you know you select it anyways here it is it's open it's assigned to Fred Ludy which is fine it automatically got assigned you can take over the ticket and send it to other department let's see let's say you are working on site as tech support on site meaning a physical location office and they call you about this ticket and you're like I don't see the ticket but you do a search and you search and you find it you can take it what you need to do is change the assignment group to to your local help desk whichever that may be let's just say in this case well I don't have one set up here that's okay let's create one real quick we're gonna call it local tech support local tech support oh there's it's a duplicate one so we do have a local tech support here somewhere a local there it is local tech support so we're gonna route it to local tech support I thought I didn't create one but I guess I did well good and then we can assign it to ourselves right away so if what am I logged in is let me just see here I'm logged in as koboman koboman let's see maybe it's in there under my first name nothing nothing oh I know what it is koboman is not part of this group that's what it is okay so that's what's going to happen that's okay you don't have to assign it it's going to go to that group anyways and whoever works for a local tech support will be able to see it and pick it up and assign it to themselves I thought I was part of this group too but I guess not I didn't assign myself to be part of this group which is very important to know so if I click update it shouldn't let me do it well see usually it shouldn't let you do it without putting a note on the ticket so keep that in mind you may get an error but it's going to be really easy and what that's going to require is a work note and if you scroll down so if you scroll down select notes here this is a work note so what you want to do is type in routed ticket to local support group and I usually sign off and then I just post a comment right I usually post a comment and for some reason Freddy picked it up again which is fine so he really wants to work it now if you want to notify the customer at the same time you know make sure that you select add additional comments which is customer visible work notes are not visible to the customer however if you select additional comments you can type in the same thing routed ticket to local support group at the same time customer slash user will get an email or notification that this is what happened so if they go look up the ticket under you know self-service which is up here you know they would actually see this on a web-based environment which you know may not be it depends how it's set up anyways it will be under self-service and they will see this comment and they will know who is actually working on it as well all right so those are the basic things when it comes to creating a ticket assigning it to proper group and assigning it to a person that is going to work it so in this case it was assigned automatically which is fine however let's see how we can resolve this ticket so if we select resolve we can certainly resolve it however we need to put in resolution information which is the third tab over so and then we have to provide provide the resolution code and we can pick for example resolved by change or user error or solution provided or whatever it is that fixed that issue you just have to be very detailed about it so what we're going to do is resolve well let's see well let's see let's call it solution provided right we're going to call it solution provided and we're going to say issue resolved you always have to specify what you've done because this ticket can be used as knowledge base and if you want to do that you can certainly do select knowledge here we're going to say issue resolved let's see here user stated that she's no longer receiving emails inside the inbox folder we're going to say issue resolved by deleting old emails so we made space in this issue in this case the issue was let's just say that the inbox was full and let's type that in inbox was full full meaning that once your inbox is full you can no longer receive new emails because there is not enough space and then from here we can select resolve down here right next to it or we can click resolve up here so let's click resolve now let's check it out and see what happened we can see that koboman resolved this and they resolved and puts a time stamp on it right i don't know if you paid attention but this was blank but that's okay we didn't have to we didn't have to fill this out okay so that covers working the tickets well i should say creating the tickets and then working the ticket and then transferring the ticket and then closing the ticket so in my opinion this should be enough to get you going to get you started in using service now as a ticketing system all right so if we click on open unassigned we can see that there are a bunch of other tickets and you know they keep coming through because this is a shared system amongst other people as well which is fine we can see that it's constantly changing people are using this system this environment for testing for development testing and if you want to take a look at this system let me know and i can possibly provide you user login for this system and this link would be to this so if you go to this link here which is https and matter of fact i'm going to zoom in so this link if you go to this link and you ask me beforehand for login information i can create a user account for you so first five people who request login to this system just so they can look around i will certainly send you that login as a user so you can view and just kind of browse around to get yourself familiarized with this system i personally prefer using a jury ticketing system because it's simpler and i like the the way it's laid out better this one's okay i guess and other things that you can do for example if you select resolve you can see the ticket that you've resolved doesn't matter whether it was assigned to you or not and then you know there are other things that we can look at as well but i just kind of wanted to create this video as not necessarily intro to this system because it's a ticketing system but it's something that people are asking me fairly frequently about service now and i'm assuming this is what they meant so here it is this is a service now ticketing system i hope you have a wonderful day and i hope you find this video useful take care bye bye
